      <p>Hey There! I'm Jack, a UK-based backend developer and creator.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm currently studying at the University of Exeter, working on an Advanced Computer Science with Business Masters Degree. I'm also Le Wagon Bali '19 and Lancaster University '17 Alumni!</p>
      <p>My main focus for my Masters degree is utilising machine learning to create a prediction model strong enough to competitively play fantasy football</p>
      <p>Work-wise, I'm currently working on some projects to try to learn more in sectors that interest me. Project areas include ecommerce, where I scaled to Â£100k revenue in 8 months, and communities, where I am building a home for seasonaires. </p>
      <p>In terms of past experience, I created Sponsor My Society, a uni sponsorship platform with clients including PwC and Accenture, established and grew Lydia's UK&I Campus Ambassador programme, and worked as a Teaching Assistant with Le Wagon Berlin.</p>

      <p>I have experience promoting & building businesses, as well as a broad backend programming skillset, namely in OOP and data science/machine learning. I'm currently learning Java & Go, as well as working with machine learning and high-performance computing & distributed systems.</p>
