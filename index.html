      <p>Hey There! I'm Jack, a UK-based backend developer and creator.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I recently graduated from the University of Exeter, where I was secured a Distinction in Advanced Computer Science with Business. I'm also Le Wagon Bali '19 and Lancaster University '17 Alumni!</p>
      <p>My main focus for my Masters degree was utilising machine learning to create a prediction model strong enough to competitively play fantasy football.</p>
      
      <p>I'm currently embarking on various projects to learn more about sectors that interest me. Project areas include e-commerce, where I have scaled to Â£250k revenue in 12 months, and SaaS, but more on that another time... </p>
      <p>My past ventures include founding <a href='www.sponsormysociety.co.uk'>Sponsor My Society</a>, a uni sponsorship platform which secured thousands to help hunreds of clubs from sponsors including PwC and Accenture. 
      I also helped established and grew both Lydia's UK&I Campus Ambassador Programme, and NorthInvest's Angel and Startup Network.</p>
